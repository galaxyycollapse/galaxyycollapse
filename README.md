Hello! I'm @galaxyycollapse!!
I'm a student focused on GameDev, but that's looking into backend as well.
I'm interested in C#, Python, C++ and Java and currently studying C# and Python.

Since I'm still learning those languages I'll not be involved in projects nor anything else. Still, I may be creating my own projects or looking into some exceptions.

If you want to reach me, I'm available on twitter! It's @yStardustKitten
