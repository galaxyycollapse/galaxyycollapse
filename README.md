Hello! I'm @galaxyycollapse!!
I like RPGs in general, bullet hell games, metroidvanias, hack n' slash... yeah, it's a really big list...
I'm currently learning C# and Python, and since I'm learning, I'm not looking to collaborate on anything, but this'll change as soon as I "finish" learning one of these languages.
If you want to reach me, I'm available on twitter! It's @yStardustKitten
